<!-- 
1) Test for constructor functionality 
2) Test for value being assigned to contructor for whatever the user inputs. ie input a word and then we will go through that word and compare each letter to the previously created LetterObject tha contains all key value pairs.
3) Test GetAll() this will allow us to loop through the user's input and compare each letter.
4) Test that we are able to compare the value of the GetAll() method to the LetterObject and see if they are comparable.
5) Test if GetAll() method finds a match within the LetterObject, return that letter + the LetterObject value of that match.
Object LetterValues{
A: 1
B: 3
C: 
}
